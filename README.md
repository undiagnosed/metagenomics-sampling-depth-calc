This calculator computes the minimum number of total sequencing reads needed to achieve at least the specified number of on-target reads at the specified probability level. The number of on-target reads is taken to be a random variable whose distribution is Poissonian. The rate is the product of the abundance and total number of reads. Please see Theorem 2 from [Wendl, et. al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3795925/) for more information.
